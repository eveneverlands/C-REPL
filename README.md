# C-REPL
REPL for C++

What is CPR? CPR stands for C++ REPL. In the future, files that run on this REPL will need the .cpr file extension.

How CPR Works?
  It creates a 'session.cpp' file and a 'session' binary file in which the code you type in REPL is written.
  When you press ENTER the file is written and 'session' binary file is executed.

Aim of this project: As it seems, this project is on its early stages and much development is needed. This project aims to provide a REPL experience similar to python (fast and snappy, atleast when compared to the current version of CPR)
